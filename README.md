# Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL
The project focuses on analyzing the Netflix catalog to identify insights and patterns using SQL for data cleaning and analysis. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides detailed information on the streaming platform's available movies and TV shows.

## Data Cleaning
To prepare the dataset for analysis, these steps were followed:
1. **Removing Duplicates**: Duplicate records were eliminated based on key attributes like show_id, title, director, country, and date_added to prevent skewed analysis results.
2. **Handling Blank Values**: Missing values, particularly in the country information, were addressed. The most common country in the dataset was used to fill in these blanks to maintain consistency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
This analysis aims to answer 25 questions, such as:
1. The distribution of content types (movies vs. TV shows) on Netflix.
2. The most prevalent genres.
3. The most frequent directors and actors.
4. Trends in the addition of new content over the years.
5. The most common ratings and their distributions.
6. Etc.

This project illustrates how SQL can be utilized to clean and analyze large datasets for valuable insights. By thoroughly cleaning the Netflix dataset, the accuracy of the analysis was ensured. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided valuable information about content distribution, popular genres, prominent directors and actors, content trends over the years, and rating distributions.
